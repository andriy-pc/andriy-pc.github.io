My responsibilities mainly were to fix bugs, write unit tests, review code and implement new functionality.

I was working on different tasks, not only related to software engineering but also partially related to server maintenance (Windows server 2019). My responsibilities were to maintain old logic (I had to have a good understanding of business processes to do that), develop new features from the scratch, and test those. To produce a new feature I had to communicate with the customer directly to find out the requirements. Because of the big amount of data in DB, I am well aware of bad performance caused by badly written SQL queries, or bad solutions in the logic. One of my responsibilities was to refactor such cases and improve performance. Also, I have experience with badly designed DB tables that caused memory leaks, so I have experience with cleaning and restructuring such tables. Also, I have a bit of experience with DB files shrinking, because a few times we had an issue with lack of memory on the DB server, and I had to deal with it. Also, I have experience in mentoring, as 3 team members were onboarded by me. I communicated with a customer and his team a lot, so I have good communication skills. A few times, I had to work on urgent tasks, so I can work under the pressure. For some time I was in the team lead role on that project, so I am experienced with task delegation and keeping the team busy.

I worked with all the aspects of the project. I've implemented the Helm chart for a separate microservice. Configured tracing via OpenTelemetry (with Jaeger collector that was part of the linkerd extensions). Configured monitoring for all the microservices with linkerd-viz extension (the hard part with this extension is that it doesn't consume metrics from other microservices, so I had to add a custom configuration for this extension). Implemented new functionality on Java (e.g. connected Elasticsearch and added logic for creating indices, storing and retrieving data) and NodeJS (e.g. proxying requests from front-end to backend) microservices. Debugged and fixed issues on both: Java and NodeJS microservices. Besides, I had to review pull requests (I was responsible for L2 review. after L2 review the logic is merged)
